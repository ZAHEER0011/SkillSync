## ⚡ SkillSync - Skill Assessment & Progress Tracker

    🚧 Project Status: Incomplete — Built as a hackathon project, but development is ongoing.

🧠 About the Project

SkillSync is a web-based platform that empowers users to assess and track their skills through interactive quizzes and a personalized dashboard. Originally conceived and built during a hackathon, the project didn't reach completion within the event timeline — but we didn’t stop there.

Despite not making it in the hackathon, SkillSync was something we truly believed in. The idea of providing a structured and engaging way for users to test their skills, monitor their growth, and get personalized feedback kept us going. This repo is a work-in-progress and will continue to evolve.
